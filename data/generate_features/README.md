- ``test_new_molecules``: Contains the same csv files, but with additional 4 molecules that were tested at a later stage of the project.
- ``ml_results``: Contains the results of the machine learning models. The file ``ml_results.xlsx`` in the main directory contains an overview of these machine learning experiments.
